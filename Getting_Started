# FSA GitHub Governance Quick Start

# Introduction  
 
Individuals employed by or under contract to the FSA shall be granted access only to information that is required to fulfil their duties.  
 
This policy applies to:  
All employees (including temporary and agency workers), independent consultants and contractors 
Members of FSA Advisory Committees and FSA Board  
Third party organisations who require access to the FSA’s information systems and facilities should also be aware of the contents of this policy.  
 
# Creating a Git Hub Account 
 
Before you can do anything on GitHub you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/join).  FSA staff should create one using their FSA details to use when working on Food Standards agency work.   

Whether you create an account or use an existing one, it must meet the following requirements;
- [Two factor authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/) must be enabled
- Your profile must have the `Name` field populated with your full name .e.g. *John Smith*.
-A profile picture is not compulsory, but changing it from the default that Gitub provides will help your team members distinguish your contributions from theirs. 
 
# Two Factor Authentication 

Please follow the GitHub help guide for Two Factor Authentication also known as 2FA

# Joining the Food Standards Agency GitHub organisation

If you are a permanent member of FSA staff we will add you to it as and when required. Else if a contractor or working on behalf of a supplier you will be added as a [collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-outside-collaborators-to-repositories-in-your-organization/) on the specific projects or teams as required. 

Contact the IT Service desk or the Team Moderator to request access providing the following details; 
-GitHub User Name 
-Email address associated with your GitHub account 
-The Project you’ll be working on 
-Team(s) you require access to and the expected duration you require access for 
 
The IT Service desk will confirm with the Project/Team owner before granting access. 
 
## Joining a Team 
The IT Helpdesk and or the Team maintainer will endeavour to add you to the appropriate teams in a timely manner once your initial request has been submitted to the IT service desk.   All members of the organisation should be able to see [all our teams](https://github.com/orgs/foodstandardsagency/teams). If there is a team applicable to you or you are to begin working on a service you will need to contact the team's maintainer to ask to join it.
